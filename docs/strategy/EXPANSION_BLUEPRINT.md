# Sangathan Expansion Blueprint

## 1. Target Segmentation Strategy

### Primary Users (The Core)
*   **Small NGOs (10-50 staff):** Struggling with compliance and data loss. Need low-cost reliability.
    *   *Barrier:* Fear of technology, data migration inertia.
*   **Student Unions:** High turnover, chaotic membership data. Need continuity.
    *   *Barrier:* Short leadership cycles, lack of institutional memory.
*   **Grassroots Collectives:** Running on WhatsApp/Excel. Need structure.
    *   *Barrier:* Trust issues, fear of surveillance.

### Secondary Users (The Scale)
*   **Mid-size NGOs:** Using expensive software (Salesforce/Zoho) but overpaying.
    *   *Barrier:* Feature gap (reporting/integrations).
*   **Advocacy Networks:** Need to coordinate across multiple chapters.
    *   *Barrier:* Need for federated data structures (future roadmap).

### Tertiary Users (The Long Tail)
*   **Local Associations (RWAs, Clubs):** Need simple dues collection and meeting logs.
    *   *Barrier:* Low tech literacy among older admins.

## 3. Institutional Outreach Plan

### Channels
1.  **University Outreach:**
    *   Target: Student Election Commissions, Debating Societies.

    *   Pitch: "Compliance-ready infrastructure for your grantees."
3.  **Civic-Tech Events:**
    *   Target: Code for India, Tech4Good.
    *   Pitch: "Open infrastructure for the ecosystem."

### Conversion Path
1.  **Demo:** 20-min "Day in the Life of an Admin" walkthrough.
2.  **Pilot:** Set up a sandbox organisation for their team.
3.  **Rollout:** Partner sends an endorsement email to their network.

    *   "Here is exactly how we secure your data (RLS explained)."
    *   "Where your ₹99 subscription goes."

## 8. Risk Mitigation Strategy

**Political Neutrality**
*   **Protocol:** Never comment on current events. Stick to "Process, not Politics."
*   **Narrative:** "We are the road builders. We don't decide where the cars go."

**Legal Inquiry**
*   **Protocol:** Strict adherence to IT Act 2000.
*   **Action:** Verify warrant -> Notify user (if legal) -> Compliance.
*   **Transparency:** Publish annual transparency report.

**Abuse Handling**
*   **Escalation:** Automated flags -> Human Review -> Suspension.
*   **Appeal:** Dedicated email channel for suspended orgs.

## 9. Long-Term Ecosystem Strategy (3-Year View)

**Year 1: The Tool**
*   Perfect the core: Members, Forms, Ledger.
*   Establish trust and reliability.

**Year 2: The Platform**
*   **API Release:** Allow other tools (mailing lists, analytics) to read Sangathan data.
*   **Volunteer Module:** Shift from "Admin-led" to "Volunteer-driven" workflows.

**Year 3: The Network**
*   **Transparency Dashboards:** Orgs can publish "Live Impact Reports" to the public.
*   **Plugin Marketplace:** Developers build niche tools (e.g., Union Election Manager) on top of Sangathan.

## 10. Metrics That Actually Matter

**North Star Metric:**
*   **Weekly Active Orgs:** Organisations that perform at least 1 critical action (log meeting, verify donation, add member) per week.

**Health Metrics:**
*   **Admin Retention:** % of admins active 3 months after signup.
*   **Data Density:** Average members per organisation (indicates real usage vs testing).
*   **Supporter Conversion:** % of active orgs converting to paid supporters.

**Anti-Metrics (Ignore):**
*   Total Signups (Vanity).
*   Social Media Followers (Irrelevant).
