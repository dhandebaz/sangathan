# Sangathan: Trust & Adoption Framework

## 1. Trust Signal Framework

**Objective:**
To assure potential users (NGOs, Unions, Samitis) that their data is safe, private, and solely under their control.

**Implementation on Website:**

*   **Data Isolation Explanation:** Clearly articulate our RLS (Row Level Security) and database isolation strategy.
*   **No Paywall Policy:** "We will never hold your data hostage." Free export tools are a core feature, not a premium one.
*   **No Data Selling Promise:** An absolute, binding commitment in our Terms of Service.
*   **Transparent Supporter Model:** Explain how we sustain operations (Supporter subscriptions, not ads/data).
*   **Public Changelog:** Demonstrate active maintenance and responsiveness.
*   **Security Architecture Explanation:** A dedicated `/security` page detailing our encryption, backup, and audit logging practices.
*   **Open Roadmap (Optional):** Show what features are coming next to build anticipation and trust.

## 2. Adoption Strategy

### A. NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations)

*   **Focus:** Institutional credibility, compliance, and donor transparency.
*   **Strategy:**
    *   **Local Trust-Building:** Partner with existing networks of NGOs for pilot programs.
    *   **Demo Webinars:** Conduct high-touch, educational sessions focused on "Digital Transformation for Non-Profits."
    *   **Template Org Setup:** Offer pre-configured workspaces for common NGO types (Education, Health, Environment).

### B. Student Unions

*   **Focus:** Membership verification, transparent elections (future), and event management.
*   **Strategy:**
    *   **Campus Ambassadors:** Recruit student leaders to champion the platform.
    *   **Student Onboarding Kit:** Digital assets (Posters, QR codes) to simplify member signup drives.
    *   **Form-Heavy Use-Case Targeting:** Highlight the use of forms for petitions, feedback, and event registrations.

### C. Grassroots Collectives (Samitis, RWAs)

*   **Focus:** Simplicity, mobile-first usage, and local language support.
*   **Strategy:**
    *   **WhatsApp Outreach Strategy:** Share short, informative videos via WhatsApp to explain the platform's value.
    *   **Simple Onboarding Videos:** Create 60-second tutorials for key tasks (Adding a member, Creating a form).
    *   **Hindi-First Documentation:** Ensure all critical help content is available in Hindi and other regional languages.

## 3. Institutional Credibility Assets

*   **Case Studies:** Detailed stories of early adopters successfully using Sangathan.
*   **White Papers:** Thought leadership pieces on "Digital Governance in India" or "The Future of Civic Tech."
*   **Advisory Board:** Announce a board of respected figures from the social sector to lend weight to the mission.
*   **Compliance Badges:** Display relevant certifications (ISO, GDPR readiness, etc.) prominently.
